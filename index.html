        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, My name is Elizabeth Njoroge" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Elizabeth Njoroge, and I come from the beautiful country of Kenya, 
            specifically the vibrant city of Eldoret. 
            I am a passionate web developer and a lover of nature and the outdoors. 
            Currently, I am studying Web Development at BYU Idaho. 
            Time spent in nature brings me peace and inspiration, 
            whether hiking through lush forests or sitting quietly by a river, 
            the outdoors always helps me reconnect with what matters most. I also enjoy travelling, writing, 
            and journaling, ways I explore both the world around me and the one within. 
            Writing helps me process life, express gratitude, and tell stories that speak to the heart. 
            I am especially interested in front-end design and love learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. 
            My dream is to build websites that are not only visually appealing but also make life easier for others. 
            As I grow in this field, I hope to blend creativity with code and eventually work remotely, 
            travel the world, and mentor those pursuing a similar path. Thank you for stopping by. 
            I am excited for what lies ahead!</p>
